# Yavashark

A new TypeScript (and JavaScript) runtime, currently in development, written in Rust. Yavashark is designed to be TypeScript-first, providing a way to run your TypeScript projects at native speeds, without the need for transpiling to JavaScript.

## Project Status

Yavashark is currently in the early stages of development. The core components, such as the parser and lexer, are being actively developed.
This means, that the runtime can't run any code yet, but it can parse it.

## Why Yavashark?

The goal of Yavashark is to provide a runtime that is optimized for TypeScript. This means you can write your code in TypeScript and run it directly, without the need to transpile it to JavaScript first. This can lead to performance improvements and a simpler development process.

## ECMA-262 Compliance

While Yavashark is currently not compliant with the ECMA-262 standard, it is a goal for the future. As the project grows and more developers contribute, It will full compliance with the standard.
